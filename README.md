# British National Grid to Longitude/Lattitude

Pure Python port of **the deprecated function** `convert_lonlat` from [lonlat_bng](https://github.com/urschrei/lonlat_bng).

**This software was only created to work around an issue with installing the much better library [convertbng](https://github.com/urschrei/convertbng).**
**It ports a now deprecated and inaccurate algorithm, which was easier to implement than a full conversion.**
**Please try installing `convertbng` instead**.

## Installation

First, try using `convertbng`:

```
pip install convertbng
```

If you are one of a small number of users for whom this doesn't work, and if you don't care about accuracy, you can try using this replacement:

```
pip install bnglonlat
```
