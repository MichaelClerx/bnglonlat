# British National Grid to Longitude/Lattitude

Pure python implementation of `convert_lonlat` from [lonlat_bng](https://github.com/urschrei/lonlat_bng).

Note: This uses the version without OSTN15 corrections, which can be several meters off.

## OSN guide

These calculations are based on [A Guide to Coordinate Systems in Great Britain](https://docs.os.uk/more-than-maps/deep-dive/a-guide-to-coordinate-systems-in-great-britain),
specifically [the equations here](https://docs.os.uk/more-than-maps/deep-dive/a-guide-to-coordinate-systems-in-great-britain/converting-between-grid-eastings-and-northings-and-ellipsoidal-latitude-and-longitude)
and constants from 
[here](https://docs.os.uk/more-than-maps/deep-dive/a-guide-to-coordinate-systems-in-great-britain/datum-ellipsoid-and-projection-information),
[here](https://docs.os.uk/more-than-maps/deep-dive/a-guide-to-coordinate-systems-in-great-britain/converting-between-3d-cartesian-and-ellipsoidal-latitude-longitude-and-height-coordinates), and
